## Contact Information ##
- I am the Tournament Organizer, zukulent0.
- You may contact me via Discord @zukulent0#7655
- The #tourneys channel on the  <a href="https://discord.gg/harddrop">Hard Drop Discord</a> will be used for scheduling matches and contacting me or your opponents.

## League Overview ##
- Games will be played on the PC version of Puyo Puyo Tetris, available through Steam.
- Game will be played on Swap Mode.
- Players will be placed in lettered leagues that roughly correspond to their skill levels.
- The different leagues are given letters (S, A, B, C, D) with S league containing the strongest players
- The maximum player count for the S league is six (6). 
- The maximum player count for the A, B, and C leagues is ten (10). 
- The D league has no player limit. 
- League size or count may be increased depending on demand
- The league will use a Round Robin tournament format. Players in the S league will match with every other player twice. Players in the A, B, and C leagues will match with every other player only once. If the D league contains ten (10) or fewer players, it will use the Round Robin tournament format. If it contains eleven (11) or more players, it will use the Swiss tournament format.
- Season one of the league will run for four (4) weeks.


## Scheduling ##
- Players will be expected to complete two (2) sets every week.
- One set is a one-on-one match that ends when one player reaches fifteen (15) wins. In other words, the first player to earn 15 stars in a one-on-one match is the winner of the set.
- League matchups will be determined when the league begins on March 8, 2019 and will be publicly available. It is your responsibility to find out who your next opponent is and schedule a match with them.
- This means that each person's weekly matchup for Weeks 1-4 will be on display and it is up to the players to contact their opponent to schedule a good time to match
- If the D league contains more than ten (10) players, scheduling will change, as each round must conclude before the next round can begin in a Swiss tournament format.
- Please post to the #tourneys channel on the Hard Drop Discord Server or message me when you and your opponent have agreed upon a time to begin your set. My contact information and a link to the Hard Drop Discord Server can be found at the top of this page.
- Since this league is an international one, we do not have a default match time because it may not be ideal for all players
- **If you do not set up a time to play your opponent, you will forfeit that match! If you do not schedule your match a second time then you will be disqualified from the league!**
- **DO NOT BE LATE!** If you are late by fifteen (15) minutes or more, you forfeit the set.
**If you do not contact your opponent and agree on a time to begin the set, you will forfeit the set. Failing to do so a second time will result in DISQUALIFICATION.**

## Match-specific Rules ##
- The recommended ruleset when making a Free Play room is: 1v1, 3 game set
- The players can use other game counts for the set (1,2) if they agree on it
- The winner must report the result of the match to the Tournament Organizer, loser does not have to
- Ideally try to have your match recorded and uploaded on a video streaming service (Youtube, Twitch, Niconico, etc...)
- Using cheats will forfeit your match and disqualify you from this league and any future leagues made by me.
- **Do not use a 4-Wide Combo setup during the first two Tetris segments of a round.** 4-Wide Combo in early-game Tetris is seriously broken and overpowered and it makes games unfair and uninteresting. For this reason we do not allow usage of it during the early-game. You are allowed downstack combo whenever, or to 4-Wide mid-game (after the first two Tetris segments).
- Recorded video will be used to settle score disputes and cheat/lag accusations. Save your replays people.

## Joining the League ##
- Please use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/gyppupQobeH50ATK2">FORM</a> to sign up for the league
- Based on the League you wish to join (S, A, B, C, D), you will fight the league gatekeeper to determine your placement
- The gatekeeper will be zukulent0
- S/A/B/C league entrants will play a FT15 qualifier match with their respective gatekeeper 
- D League entrants will play a FT3 set with zukulent0.
- **To determine league placement, everyone will be ranked based on their gatekeeper match results. After registration period is over the entrants will be split into their respective leagues**
- **For example, #1-6 goes to S League. #7-16 A League, #17-26 B League, etc... adding leagues until everyone has been placed in one.**
- D LEAGUE HAS NO LIMIT ON PLAYER COUNT!!!
- This league is available for anyone in the world to join! But....
- If you are determined to be unplayable due to lag, then you may not enter the League at our own discretion.
- If you do not know which league you should sign up for, please use the table below:
