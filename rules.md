## Contact Information ##
- Hello! My name is **zukulent0** and I'm organizing this PPT Swap League!
- You may contact me directly on Discord via my tag **zukulent0#7655**.
- The <a href="https://discord.gg/harddrop">Hard Drop Discord</a> channel will host a specific channel for the League at **#tourneys**. We will use this channel to communicate tournament matters such as scheduling matches.

## League Overview ##
- Game used is Puyo Puyo Tetris for the PC (Steam)
- Players will be placed on leagues that will contain players who belong in the same skill level
- The different leagues are given letters (S, A, B, C, D) with S league containing the strongest players
- Maximum player count for S League is 6 players
- Maximum player count for A, B, and C Leagues is 10 players
- D League has NO PLAYER LIMIT!
- League size or count may be increased depending on demand
- Leagues will run on a Round Robin bracket: S League will play every player in the league twice while the other leagues (A/B/C) will play every player in the league only once
- Depending on size, D League will either run as Round Robin (10 or less) or Swiss format (11 or more)
- The run time for this League Season is 4 weeks


## Scheduling ##
- Players are expected to play **2 FT15 sets** a week
- A **FT15 set** is defined as 2 players having a 1v1 match where the first player to win 15 individual games is the winner
- The overall schedule of the league should be determined by the time the league starts
- This means that each person's weekly matchup for Weeks 1-4 will be on display and it is up to the players to contact their opponent to schedule a good time to match
- Scheduling for D League will be different if it runs Swiss since the current round needs to finish before determining the schedule for the next round
- Please message the Tournament Organizer (me) when you and your opponent have agreed on a match time. Ideally use the HD #tourneys channel.
- Since this league is an international one, we do not have a default match time because it may not be ideal for all players
- **If you do not set up a time to play your opponent, you will forfeit that match! If you do not schedule your match a second time then you will be disqualified from the league!**
- DO NOT BE LATE for your matches. If you are late for more than 15 minutes you forfeit the set. 

## Match-specific Rules ##
- The recommended ruleset when making a Free Play room is: 1v1, 3 game set
- The players can use other game counts for the set (1,2) if they agree on it
- The winner must report the result of the match to the Tournament Organizer, loser does not have to
- Ideally try to have your match recorded and uploaded on a video streaming service (Youtube, Twitch, Niconico, etc...)
- Using cheats will forfeit your match and disqualify you from this league and any future leagues made by me.
- **Do not use a 4-Wide Combo setup during the first two Tetris segments of a round.** 4-Wide Combo in early-game Tetris is seriously broken and overpowered and it makes games unfair and uninteresting. For this reason we do not allow usage of it during the early-game. You are allowed downstack combo whenever, or to 4-Wide mid-game (after the first two Tetris segments).
- Recorded video will be used to settle score disputes and cheat/lag accusations. Save your replays people.

## Joining the League ##
- Please use this <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/gyppupQobeH50ATK2">FORM</a> to sign up for the league
- Based on the League you wish to join (S, A, B, C, D), you will fight the league gatekeeper to determine your placement
- The gatekeeper will be zukulent0
- S/A/B/C league entrants will play a FT15 qualifier match with their respective gatekeeper 
- D League entrants will play a FT3 set with zukulent0.
- **To determine league placement, everyone will be ranked based on their gatekeeper match results. After registration period is over the entrants will be split into their respective leagues**
- **For example, #1-6 goes to S League. #7-16 A League, #17-26 B League, etc... adding leagues until everyone has been placed in one.**
- D LEAGUE HAS NO LIMIT ON PLAYER COUNT!!!
- This league is available for anyone in the world to join! But....
- If you are determined to be unplayable due to lag, then you may not enter the League at our own discretion.
- If you do not know which league you should sign up for, please use the table below:
