Hello and welcome! This is my first League and it is open to everyone! Please read the rules before filling out the registration form.

Registration starts on February 20th up to March 6th, and Qualifier (League placement) matches start on February 20th up to March 7th.

Week 1 matches start on March 8th, so I hope everyone is ready!

Note we are using the <a href="https://discord.gg/harddrop">**Hard Drop Discord**</a> to schedule everything related to the League in the **#tourneys** channel, so please join us there!

I'm looking forward to playing with you in the qualifier matches and I hope everyone can have fun!

**Thanks everyone for pushing me to do this league!**
